<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Now it is time to make a working game!</p>

<p>In the last stage, make it so you can play a full game with a friend. First one of you moves as X, and then the other one moves as O.</p>

<p>You need to create a game loop. The game starts with empty cells and ends when someone wins or there is a draw. You need to output the final result after the end of the game.</p>

<p>Good luck gaming!</p>
